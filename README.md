Just another naive locker for Linux

## Why this

I was just reading a book and then I found out that we can change the permissions of a directory to none for all the users and that basically doesn't let any program except rm access the directory.

Hence, I created a small, naive script that just adds the ability to change those permissions with a password, which means that the dir can be __locked__ using the password.

## Dependencies

Are you kidding me? It's written in Shell, no dependencies, enjoy.

## Credits

Probably the book ```UNIX: concepts and applications``` by Sumitabha Das.
